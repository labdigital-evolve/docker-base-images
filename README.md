# Evolve docker base images

## Using the images

If you want to run these images on your laptop the easiest way is to use the github client in combination with a docker
login helper.

Install the gh client via brew install gh and then follow the steps
at https://gist.github.com/mislav/e154d707db230dc882d7194ec85d79f6 Note that you might need additional permissions, use
gh auth refresh --scopes=read:packages,write:packages to add additional scopes to your token.
